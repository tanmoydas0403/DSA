Game of Two Stack:
------------------

Alexa has two stacks of non-negative integers, stack a[n] and stack b[m] where index 0 denotes the top of the stack.
Alexa challenges Nick to play the following game:

-> In each move, Nick can remove one integer from the top of either
 stack a or stack b
-> Nick keeps a running sum of the integers he removes from the two
 stacks.
-> Nick is disqualified from the game if, at any point, his running
 sum becomes greater than some integer maz Sum given at the
 beginning of the game,
-> Nick's final score is the total number of integers he has removed from the two stacks.

Given a, b, and maz Sum for g games, find the maximum possible score Nick can achieve.
Example:
a=[1,2,3,4,5
b=(6,7,8,9)
The maximum number of values Nick can remove is 4. There are two sets of choices with this result.
1. Remove 1, 2, 3, 4 from a with a sum of 10.
2. Remove 1,2,3 from a and 6 from & with a sum of 12
